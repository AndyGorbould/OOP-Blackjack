# OOP-Blackjack

Create a blackjack game in PHP using OOP.
Properties must be private, so getters & setters are necessary.

### PROBLEMS:
In the constructor of the Player class; draw 2 cards for the player. You have to use an existing method for this from the Deck class. ----> needs each to be pushed to "private $cards" on player.php ?
